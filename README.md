# A "Sort-of" Analogy
Sometimes it's easiest to explain what something is using an analogy - even when that analogy is a bit incorrect. With this said, you can "sort-of" think of Matcheos as a Tinder with an EOS layer. Instead of swiping on people you like, you make an EOS bid. And once a match is made, you incorporate a smart contract to align incentives.

# Simplified Example
Assume Matcheos contains 6 people (Alice, Bob, Charles, Dave, Eve and Fran). All 6 people have profiles. Each person can browse through other people's profiles and submit a EOS bid. For example, Alice can bid 1 EOS to meet Bob and 5 EOS to meet Charles. Dave can bid 5 EOS to meet Fran. Etc. Etc.

At certain intervals, matches are made according to a double-blind opt-in algorithm. At the end of this process, there should be certain matches. Bob and Alice may be a match. Fran and Charles may be a match. Once a match is made, both people have the option to accept. You don't have to accept a match. However, if you accept, you are required to send your bid into a smart contract. 

Let's assume Dave and Fran are a match. Dave has bid 5 EOS to meet Fran. And Fran has bid 3 EOS to meet Dave. If both accept, they send their bids to a smart contract. Dave must send 5 EOS and Fran must send 3 EOS. So the total contract now has 8 EOS.

The rest of the Matcheos process is how the 8 EOS is released from the smart contract. When a match is accepted, the first person who accepts chooses a smart contract. This person chooses the mechanics of the smart contract: including it's release steps, release function, and end goal. Assuming no fees and no arbitration, both Fran and Dave would receive their EOS back at the conclusion of the smart contract.

# A Single User Flow
For a single user, the flow is as follows:
1. Create an account within EOS.
2. Acquire some EOS tokens.
3. Create a profile within Matcheos.
4. Browse through other people's profiles.
5. Submit bids on people you want to meet.
6. Receive matches from the Matcheos system.
7. Accept a match.
8. Send your EOS bid into the smart contract.
9. Interact with the match.
10. Receive some (or all) of your EOS back.

# Different Purposes
Matcheos can be used to match any grouping. It can be used for dating. It can be used for companies, where there is a match between the potential employee and the employer. Or it can be used for finding friends.

# Bidding
Bids are just indications of interest. At the time of the bid, you don't lose control of your EOS. But you need to have an account balance that is at least as great as your bid. Unless you are a whale, you won't be able to make a bid of millions of EOS.

# Matching
Bids will be weighted according to a user's balance. So the higher the percentage of your total balance you bid, the more likely it is you will be matched with that person. The desired outcome of the matching process is to match up 2 people who have expressed a high preference for each other. You may really like someone, but if they don't like you, the match is probably not good. 

# Communication
The communication should be problem free. That's the goal. Here is where the smart contract comes in. Because tokens are at risk, both people should behave. If they misbehave, they may lose their tokens through aribitration.
