# Matching

When you make an offer to meet someone, you are signaling a preference. Offers are made with EOS tokens. Two people are matched via the Matcheos double-blind, opt-in algorithm. 

# Smart Contracts
![alt text](https://github.com/crypto5000/matcheos/blob/master/img/accept.png "Smart Contracts")
Two people agree to the terms of the contract upfront. Neither person has to accept a match. And either person can terminate the contract at any time (before it's finished).

# Interaction
![alt text](https://github.com/crypto5000/matcheos/blob/master/img/finish.png "Interaction")
The two people take steps interacting in a chat format. As the interaction progresses, staked EOS is released back to each person.

# Arbitration
![alt text](https://github.com/crypto5000/matcheos/blob/master/img/arbitration.png "Arbitration")
If a person breaches the Code of Conduct (see code.html), they are subject to arbitration. In arbitration, staked EOS tokens can be forfeited and donated to charity (assuming the person violated the Code).

# A Single User Flow for the Alpha Version
For a single user, the flow is as follows:
1. Create an account profile within EOS. (Only an email is required)
2. Browse through other people's profiles.
3. Submit offers on people you want to meet.
4. Receive matches from the Matcheos system.
5. Accept a match.
6. Send your EOS offer into the smart contract.
7. Interact with the match.
8. Receive some (or all) of your EOS back.
