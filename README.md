# Matching
![alt text](https://github.com/crypto5000/matcheos/blob/master/img/contract1.gif "Matching")
When you make an offer to meet someone, you are signaling a preference. Offers are made with EOS tokens. Two people are matched via the Matcheos double-blind, opt-in algorithm. 

# Smart Contracts
![alt text](https://github.com/crypto5000/matcheos/blob/master/img/accept.png "Smart Contracts")
Assume Matcheos contains 6 people (Alice, Bob, Charles, Dave, Eve and Fran). All 6 people have profiles. Each person can browse through other people's profiles and submit a EOS bid. For example, Alice can bid 1 EOS to meet Bob and 5 EOS to meet Charles. Dave can bid 5 EOS to meet Fran. Etc. Etc.

# Arbitration
![alt text](https://github.com/crypto5000/matcheos/blob/master/img/arbitration.png "Arbitration")
If a person breaches the Code of Conduct (see code.html), they are subject to arbitration. In arbitration, staked EOS tokens can be forfeited and donated to charity (assuming the person violated the Code).

# A Single User Flow for the Alpha Version
For a single user, the flow is as follows:
1. Create an account profile within EOS. (Only an email is required)
2. Browse through other people's profiles.
3. Submit offers on people you want to meet.
4. Receive matches from the Matcheos system.
5. Accept a match.
6. Send your EOS offer into the smart contract.
7. Interact with the match.
8. Receive some (or all) of your EOS back.

# Different Purposes
Matcheos can be used to match any grouping. It can be used for dating. It can be used for companies, where there is a match between the potential employee and the employer. Or it can be used for finding friends.
